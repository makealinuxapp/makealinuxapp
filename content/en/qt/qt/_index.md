## Qt

Qt is a development framework for creating cross-platform applications and user interfaces.
The Qt Widgets Module provides a set of UI elements to create classic desktop-style user interfaces.
Applications built with it can run not only on Linux, but also on Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems at native capabilities and speed with little or no change in the codebase.
